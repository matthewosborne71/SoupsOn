And at the same time he is pursued by the destruction that Hulk causes, what culminates in more complications in his life. However, Bruce Banner is a self-sacrificing and heroic person. Endowed with a super-genius intellect, he is also one of the most brilliant and resourceful minds on Earth. Banner is constantly undertaken his career as a superhero while trying to find a cure for his condition. For a time Banner strategically acted in consonance with his Hulk persona, thus giving the Hulk a purpose. Banner has also stated that Hulk's reasoning and intelligence tend to fluctuate depending upon a number of factors at the moment of transformation.

The Savage Hulk is the reflection of the young child abused by his father, which is the source of extreme rage and resentment from which his dynamic strength is derived. However, he is naive, innocent, and kind. He often claims that he wants to be left alone, but this is because he is constantly attacked without the capacity to understand why. He really wants to be liked and is very loyal to his friends. The Savage Hulk is usually depicted as green-skinned and heavily-muscled with a loping, ape-like gait. While in a functionally calm emotional state, or at least as calm as the Hulk can be, the Savage Hulk is stronger than the Gray Hulk. While angry, he has the potential for limitless strength, depending on the height of his temper.\n",

      "           The Gray Hulk has average intelligence, although he occasionally displays knowledge and intellectual ability normally associated with Banner. He is cunning, crafty, hedonistic, arrogant, and distant, with a hidden conscience; various psychological assessments of the Hulks have identified this Hulk as the personification of the moody teenager that Banner never allowed himself to be. In most of his Las Vegas appearances, he appears only at night. According to the Leader, the Gray Hulk persona is strongest during the night of the new moon and weakest during the full moon. This aversion to sun/moon light vanished when the Gray Hulk's night-induced transformation trigger was later removed. Although he is the smallest of the Hulks, the Gray Hulk towers over the average human. He prefers to dress in tailored suits. The Joe Fixit's base strength level is also the lowest of the three primary Hulk incarnations.\n",

After a few nights, the Grey Hulk gained an average human intelligence. Some time later, the Savage Grey Hulk re-emerged during his encounter with the Distorter, with his rage preventing him to be controlled by the Distorter. Many years later, after the Hulk was caught in a gamma explosion, the Savage Grey Hulk re-emerged once again, but this time he destroyed part of Las Vegas and fought the Fantastic Four members The Thing and the Human Torch during his rampage.\n",

At this period in Banner's life, he had just gained control over the Hulk's body, but was constantly on alert and terrified this was just temporarily, and that the Hulk, which he saw as nothing but a savage and destructive beast, would break free once more when the world least expected it. Far from being identical with the original Hulk, this version was based on a nightmarish imagination made of all of Banner's worst fears and ideas of his former alter ego. Nightmare continued to manipulate and increase his influence, allowing this dark incarnation to gradually rise to the surface. It finally became its own personality after Banner made his \"psychic suicide,\" allowing it to break free of Banner's domination. Eventually, with the assistance of three creatures created by his subconscious, (Glow, Goblin, and Guardian), this Hulk gained the ability to speak and behave much less savagely. Since then, this personality has not been seen again, and it has been suggested that it is no longer a part of Banner's personality. A part of the Hulk, with the assistance of Doctor Strange, entered the Dimension of Nightmare as a similar manifestation as Mindless Hulk, threatening to kill him. Nightmare was forced to seek out Spider-Man's help, as this Hulk was destroying the whole domain. Spider-Man eventually pushed the Hulk into another realm, but he pulled Nightmare in with him. Nightmare has since been seen still alive, but this Hulk seems to have disappeared.\n",

More recent events have shown that the power to see astral forms may now extend to Bruce Banner. However, it was suggested the clarity of the astral forms is diminished when compared to the Hulk's ability to view them. The Hulk's ability to see astral forms may go beyond just seeing individual spirits. The Hulk once experienced a whole town in the middle of the desert that then faded away into nothing.

In the television series, Banner's first name was changed from Robert to David and he was never called by his middle name Bruce, only David. On the DVD commentary of the pilot, series developer and executive producer Kenneth Johnson explained that it was a way to honor his late son David. Also, according to Stan Lee, Universal changed the name because \"Bruce\" sounded, in the eyes of the network, like a \"gay\" name, and David sounded much better.\n",

    "Wow `BeautifulSoup` is awesome! But as we saw in our most recent example, real websites are messy and it would be a hassle to have to go through every website using the developer tool like we just did. Luckily, people have had that very thought and developed python wrappers for APIs for various sites. We'll go over a couple of those next. But first, if you're interested in learning more about `BeautifulSoup` check out the documentation here, https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now these APIs exist for many of your favorite services like Twitter, Reddit, Spotify, and more. Now for a number of sites you'd have to write your own code to interact with the API, however, for the most popular digital services someone else has already done that for us. We'll go through a couple different examples of python wrappers for APIs.\n",

    "Perhaps you've seen a shot chart like the one seen here, https://i.redd.it/6g9o1dwz1oc21.png. Maybe you'd like to make code to make a chart just like that, but how do you get the data? The data exists here, https://stats.nba.com, but as we said you don't want go copy and paste the data by hand, and beautiful soup code might be a hassle. Enter the package `nba_api`. This package is a python wrapper for the nba stats API. You can find its documentation here on github, https://github.com/swar/nba_api. We'll now show how we can grab nba shot chart data with `nba_api`. \n",

You can set up an account here, https://www.reddit.com, and you can grab your credentials by creating an \"app\" here, https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps. Note: In doing this you are agreeing not to use the data for commercial reasons. If you plan on developing an application in order to profit from Reddit data you need the explicit approval from Reddit. Don't mess around in this arena, you don't want a lawsuit on your hands.\n",

If you explain that you're using it to learn and for academic research I've been told the process is relatively quick.
