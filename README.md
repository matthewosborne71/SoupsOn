# SoupsOn

This repository will contain files for a special lecture on web scraping and
accessing APIs using python. This is in conjunction with the Erd\&#337s Institute's
2019 coding bootcamp.

During this lecture I will demonstrate how you can use <a href = "https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">BeautifulSoup</a> to scrape data from an html page. I will also demonstrate a
couple of python interfaces for APIs of popular websites including Twitter,
Reddit, Spotify, and the NBA stats website.
